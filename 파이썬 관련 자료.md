- 점프 투 파이썬 (https://wikidocs.net/book/1)

  이 책은 파이썬이란 언어를 처음 접해보는 독자들과 프로그래밍을 한 번도 해 본적이 없는 사람들을 대상으로 한다. 프로그래밍을 할 때 사용되는 전문적인 용어들을 알기 쉽게 풀어서 쓰려고 노력하였으며, 파이썬이란 언어의 개별적인 특성만을 강조하지 않고 프로그래밍 전반에 관한 사항을 파이썬이란 언어를 통해 알 수 있도록 알기 쉽게 설명하였다.

  파이썬에 대한 기본적인 지식을 알고 있는 사람이라도 이 책은 파이썬 프로그래밍에 대한 흥미를 가질 수 있는 좋은 안내서가 될 것이다. 이 책의 목표는 독자가 파이썬을 통해 프로그래밍에 대한 전반적인 이해를 갖게하는 것이며, 또 파이썬이라는 도구를 이용하여 원하는 프로그램을 쉽고 재미있게 만들 수 있게 하는 것이다.
  
- 왕초보를 위한 Python (https://wikidocs.net/book/2)

  프로그래밍을 한번도 해본 적이 없는 분들을 위해, 파이썬을 통해 처음으로 프로그래밍을 시작하도록 도와드립니다.

  

### 수업

- 모두를 위한 파이썬 (https://www.edwith.org/pythonforeverybody)

  전 세계 백만명이 넘게 수강하고 있는 Michigan 대학 Charles Severance 교수님의 인기 MOOC 강좌인 “Python for Everybody” 동영상과 강의 노트를 한국어로 번역하여 제공합니다. 파이썬은 웹 서비스, 데이터 분석, 머신러닝에서 강세를 보이며 널리 쓰이는 언어로, 쉽지만 강력한 언어입니다.

  총 5개의 연속된 작은 강의들을 통해 파이썬 언어의 문법에서 시작해 자료구조, 웹 데이터 추출 및 데이터베이스를 포함한 기본적인 프로그래밍 개념을 차근차근 소개합니다. 마지막 캡스톤 프로젝트에서는 앞 코스에서 학습한 전반적인 내용을 이용해 데이터 검색, 처리 및 시각화를 위한 응용 프로그램을 설계하고 제작합니다.
